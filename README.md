# protoc plugin for angular

Generates injectable angular services. Methods take 1 argument and returns an Observable if it's a stream or a Promise otherwise.

:warning: This plugin was created for and relies on [grpc-gen](github.com/zaucy/grpc-gen). It is intended for protoc-gen-ngx to be standalone in the future.
